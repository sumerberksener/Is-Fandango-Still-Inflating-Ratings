# Is-Fandango-Still-Inflating-Ratings-
In October 2015, a data journalist named Walt Hickey analyzed movie ratings data and found strong evidence to suggest that Fandango's rating system was biased and dishonest (Fandango is an online movie ratings aggregator).
Hickey found that there's a significant discrepancy between the number of stars displayed to users and the actual rating, which he was able to find in the HTML of the page.

In this project I investigated the ratings found on Fandango's website using the [dataset collected by Hickey](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/fandango) and a more [recent one](https://github.com/mircealex/Movie_ratings_2016_17) collected by a member of Dataquest, after Fandango claimed that they had fixed the bug in the system.

After my statistical analysis and carrying out data visualisation, I concluded that indeed there was a change in the movie ratings on Fandango's website after Hickey's article. I have found that the median of the movie ratings has stayed about the same, however, there was significant reduction in the mode and mean of the movie ratings on Fandango.
